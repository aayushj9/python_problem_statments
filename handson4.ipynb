    "Problem Statement 4: Guess the Number Game\n",
    "Objective:\n",
    "Create a Python program that allows the user to play a number guessing game.\n",
    "\n",
    "Background:\n",
    "Guessing games are a fun way to learn how to handle loops, conditionals, and user input in programming. In this task, you will build a simple game where the computer randomly selects a number, and the user has to guess it within a certain number of attempts.\n",
    "\n",
    "Requirements:\n",
    "\n",
    "Input:\n",
    "\n",
    "The program should randomly select a number between 1 and 100 (inclusive).\n",
    "The user should be allowed to input their guesses.\n",
    "Process:\n",
    "\n",
    "The program should compare the user's guess to the randomly selected number.\n",
    "If the guess is too high, the program should inform the user that their guess was too high.\n",
    "If the guess is too low, the program should inform the user that their guess was too low.\n",
    "The user should be given a maximum of 10 attempts to guess the correct number.\n",
    "Output:\n",
    "\n",
    "If the user guesses correctly, the program should congratulate them and display the number of attempts taken.\n",
    "If the user fails to guess the number within 10 attempts, the program should reveal the correct number and end the game.\n",
    "Bonus Features :\n",
    "\n",
    "Track and display the user's previous guesses to help them avoid repeating the same guess.\n",
    "Allow the user to play multiple rounds and keep track of their score.\n"
