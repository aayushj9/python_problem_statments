    "Problem Statement 1: Simple Budget Tracker\n",
    "\n",
    "Objective:\n",
    "Create a Python program that helps users track their daily expenses and calculate their remaining budget for the month.\n",
    "\n",
    "Background:\n",
    "Managing personal finances is essential, and one of the first steps in doing so is keeping track of daily expenses. As a beginner in Python, you will create a simple application that allows users to input their daily expenses and view their remaining budget.\n",
    "\n",
    "Requirements:\n",
    "\n",
    "Input:\n",
    "\n",
    "The program should start by asking the user for their total budget for the month.\n",
    "Each day, the user can input their daily expenses in various categories (e.g., food, transportation, entertainment).\n",
    "Process:\n",
    "\n",
    "The program should keep a running total of the expenses.\n",
    "After each input, the program should update the total expenses and subtract it from the monthly budget to show the remaining budget.\n",
    "Output:\n",
    "\n",
    "Display the total amount spent so far.\n",
    "Display the remaining budget.\n",
    "If the user tries to spend more than their remaining budget, the program should display a warning message.\n",
    "Bonus Features:\n",
    "\n",
    "Allow users to categorize their expenses and display a breakdown of expenses by category.\n",
    "Add the ability for the user to reset their budget and start over.\n"
