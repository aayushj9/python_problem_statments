    "Problem Statement 5: Temperature Converter\n",
    "Objective:\n",
    "Create a Python program that converts temperatures between Celsius, Fahrenheit, and Kelvin using functions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Background:\n",
    "Temperature conversion is a common task in science and everyday life. In this problem, you will create a program that allows users to convert temperatures from one scale to another by defining and using functions. This will help you understand how to encapsulate logic within functions and reuse code.\n",
    "\n",
    "Requirements:\n",
    "\n",
    "Input:\n",
    "\n",
    "The program should prompt the user to enter a temperature value.\n",
    "The user should also specify the current scale of the temperature (Celsius, Fahrenheit, or Kelvin) and the scale to which they want to convert.\n",
    "Process:\n",
    "\n",
    "Create separate functions for each type of conversion:\n",
    "celsius_to_fahrenheit(celsius)\n",
    "celsius_to_kelvin(celsius)\n",
    "fahrenheit_to_celsius(fahrenheit)\n",
    "fahrenheit_to_kelvin(fahrenheit)\n",
    "kelvin_to_celsius(kelvin)\n",
    "kelvin_to_fahrenheit(kelvin)\n",
    "Use these functions to perform the conversion based on user input.\n",
    "Output:\n",
    "\n",
    "Display the converted temperature value with the appropriate scale.\n",
    "Bonus Features:\n",
    "\n",
    "Allow the user to convert multiple temperatures in one session.\n",
    "Provide a summary of all conversions performed in the session."
